    #   array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
    #          [ 0.,  0.,  0.]])

    # We are going to put the features down a given row; the instances
    # one in each column.  We need to subtract off the Mean feature -
    # array.mean(0) returns the mean for each column; array.mean(1)
    # returns the mean for each row.  Therefore the mean Kernel is
    # M.mean(1).
    meanM = M.mean(1)
